    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Hello, I am Garmisch, I consider myself an inventor and problem solver. I love solving real-world problems by appropriately applying technology. On my quest to be better equipped in the tech field, I have chosen to major in Integrative Systems and Design, with an extended major in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Robotics at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

      I am very interested in enhancing the ability of robots by merging AI and robots, I believe that achiving this allows robots to be more adaptive to the real world environments, take on new tasks and break free from the hard-coded repetitive tasks.
