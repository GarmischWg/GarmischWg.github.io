## Introduction
- ABU robocon is an international robotics competition
- Each year, a new set of game rule would be release
    - These games often reference real world activites, such as farming, badminton etc.
- Foundational technologies are applied, refined and passed onto next generation team members 

## Main Development
- I joined the mechanics team out of the 3 sub teams (Mechan, Software and Electronics)
    - Because it is the most difficult to learn at home, i.e. you need a lot of heavy/specialized equipments
- This formed my foundational knowledge and gave me important empirical experience in robot design and manufacturing
- Working in a collaborative environment, understanding the dynamics and needs of each sub teams
- Gain experience working in demanding environment
