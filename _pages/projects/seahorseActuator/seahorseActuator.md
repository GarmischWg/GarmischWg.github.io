### Research Experience

- **Current Project**: Developing a seahorse tail-inspired hydraulic soft actuator.
   - Combines pre-curled mechanics and material stiffness for enhanced hooking force.
   - Differentiates from traditional soft actuators that rely solely on hydraulic/pneumatic force.

- **Key Responsibilities**:
   - Design and implement characterization experiments.
   - Develop control systems for the actuator.
   - Facilitate application demonstrations.

- Experiment setup

- **Skills Developed**:
   - Conducted thorough literature reviews to inform experimental design.
   - Streamlined design processes by standardizing protocols based on comparable studies.
   - Minimized variabilities (e.g., vibrations, structural flex) to enhance accuracy and reliability of results.

- **Research Demo**: Designed and built a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) extension unit.
   - Functionality: Deploys the actuator as an underwater gripper/anchor.
   - Integrated electronic components and a pressure control system that draws water directly from the ocean.
   - Facilitated underwater tasks such as anchoring and gripping.
   - Served as a demonstration project for visiting professionals in the marine industry.

- Underwater demo

- **Collaborative Engagement**:
   - Actively participate in weekly research team meetings.
   - Engaged in discussions on diverse issues in soft robotics.
   - Expanded understanding of the field and identified current research gaps.
   - Gained insights into the PhD student experience and strategies for success.

### Research output
- We have published a workshop paper at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, 2nd Workshop on Dexterous Manipulation.
    -  Accessible here: [https://openreview.net/forum?id=2uDOjKQG85](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2uDOjKQG85)
- We are currently working on simulations for the actuator and aims to release the final paper at the coming January
